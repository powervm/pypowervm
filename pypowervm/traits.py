class APITraits(object):
    """Represents capabilities inherent to the backing API server.

    For instance, depending on a schema version, or the backing REST server,
    there may be different code paths that the user needs to go through.

    A key example of this would be the VirtualNetworks.  The HMC requires
    that Virtual Networks be the driver of code paths for various code paths.
    However, in other API servers, the Virtual Networks are simply realized
    based off the VLANs/virtual switches that adapters are currently tied
    to.

    This class encapsulates the various traits so that tasks and users do not
    have to inspect the header data directly to determine how the API should
    behave.

        Some APIs (such as modifying the SEA or creating a Client Network
        Adapter) require that the VirtualNetwork (or VNet wrapper) be
        pre-created for the operation.  This is typically done when working
        against an HMC.

        This trait will return True if the Virtual Networks need to be
