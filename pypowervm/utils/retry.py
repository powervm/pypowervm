    '''Retry method decorator

    :param tries: The max number of calls to the wrapped method.
    :param delay_func: A method to delay before retrying.
        Defaults to no delay.
        The parameters that are sent are:
            - the number of the current try
            - the maximum number of tries
            - the arguments to the decorated method
            - the keyword arguments to the decorated method
        No return value is expected.
    :param retry_except: A list of exceptions to retry if received.
        Defaults to no exceptions besides the HttpError which is
        handled separately by the http_codes parameter.
    :param http_codes: A list of http response codes to retry if received.
        Default is to not handle any specific http codes.
    :param test_func: A method to call to determine whether to retry. This
        method takes precedence over http codes. That is, if specified, the
        http codes are not considered.
        The parameters that are sent are:
            - the exception that was received
            - the number of the current try
            - the maximum number of tries
            - the arguments to the decorated method
            - the keyword arguments to the decorated method
        The return value is expected to be boolean, True or False, where
            True means to retry the decorated method.
    :param resp_checker: A method to call when no exception is caught, to
        check the response and determine whether to retry.
        The parameters that are sent are:
            - the number of the current try
            - the maximum number of tries
            - the arguments to the decorated method
            - the keyword arguments to the decorated method
        The return value is expected to be boolean, True or False, where
            True means to retry the decorated method.
    :param limit_except: An exception to raise if the number of tries is
        exhausted.
    :returns: The return value of the wrapped method.
