    This method takes in a vSCSI mapping for a Virtual I/O Server and performs
    the mapping.

    The extra intelligence that this method provides is that it will fuse
    common vSCSI mappings together.  The fusing looks at the source and target
    and will determine if they can re-utilize an existing scsi mapping.

    This reduces the number of server/client adapters that are required to the
    virtual machine.  However, there is a limit to how much fusing should be
    done before a new vSCSI mapping bus is used.  That can be defined by
    specifying the 'fuse_limit'.

    The fuse_limit should be set low if the scsi bus is going to be quite busy.
    If the traffic over the scsi bus is going to be low, a significantly
    higher limit can be used.  If you are unsure what the traffic will be, use
    the default.

                      added to.

                     with another scsi mapping on the virtual I/O server.
    :param fuse_limit: (Optional) The max number of devices to allow on one
                       scsi bus before creating a second SCSI bus.
