    Metrics are expensive to gather and to parse.  It is expensive because
    the backing API gathers all of the metrics at the Hypervisor and Virtual
    I/O Server levels.  This returns all of the LPARs.  Therefore, this cache
    parses in all of the data once, and allows the invoker to get individual
    LPAR metrics without having to re-query the API server.

    This class provides a caching mechanism along with a built in refresh
    mechanism if enough time has passed since last gathering the metrics.

    This cache will obtain the metrics for a given system, separate them out
    into an individual LparMetric cache.  If another LPAR is required, the
    cache will be used (so a subsequent API call is not required).

    There is a refresh_interval as well.  If the interval is passed, a
    subsequent query of the metrics will force a refresh of the cache.

    The previous metric is also saved within the cache.  This is useful for
    generating rates on the metrics (a previous element to compare against).

    The cache will only contain the last two samples of hypervisor/vios data.
    This is so that the current sample and the previous sample are maintained.
    The data is maintained for all of the systems that metrics data has data
    for - but this is still quite thin.  This cache does not have support
    to maintain additional samples.

    Trimming is done upon each refresh (which is triggered by the
    get_latest_metric).  To wipe the cache, the user should just have the cache
    go out of scope and it will be cleared.  No manual clean up is required.
