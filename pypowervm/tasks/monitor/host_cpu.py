    PowerVM only gathers the CPU statistics once every 30 seconds.  It does
    this to reduce overhead.  There is a function to gather statistics quicker,
    but that can be very expensive.  Therefore, to ensure that the client's
    workload is not impacted, these 'longer term' metrics will be used.

    This class builds off of a base pypowervm function where it can obtain
    the samples through a PCM 'cache'.  If a new sample is available, the cache
    pulls the sample.  If it is not, the existing sample is used.

    This can result in multiple, quickly successive calls to the host stats
    returning the same data (because a new sample may not be available yet).

    The class analyzes the data and keeps running counts of total, user, and
    firmware cycles.
